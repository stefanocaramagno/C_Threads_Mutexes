# C (Threads and Mutexes)

**Hello everyone!**

My name is [Stefano Caramagno](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanocaramagno), and I'm pleased to present this repository containing exercises on **threads and mutexes** implemented in **C programming**.  
These exercises were completed as part of the **Operating Systems** course during my [Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering](https://www.dieei.unict.it/corsi/l-8-inf) at the [University of Catania](https://www.unict.it).

## üåç Context

This repository focuses on multi-threaded programming concepts using the POSIX threads (pthread) library and mutex synchronization mechanisms in Unix/Linux systems using C programming.  
The exercises cover thread creation, synchronization using mutexes, thread-safe data access, deadlock prevention, and practical applications of multi-threading in concurrent programming.

## üéØ Objectives

- **Thread Management**: Understand thread creation, termination, and synchronization mechanisms using mutexes.
- **Concurrency Control**: Develop thread-safe programming techniques to prevent data races and ensure thread synchronization.
- **Practical Applications**: Apply multi-threading concepts to solve problems requiring concurrent execution and synchronization.

## üìÇ Contents

- **Basic Thread Creation**: Exercises on creating and managing threads using the POSIX threads (pthread) library. 
- **Mutex Basics**: Exercises on implementing basic mutex operations to synchronize access to shared resources among threads.
- **Advanced Mutex Usage**: Exercises exploring deadlock scenarios and implementing solutions using mutexes.
- **Practical Multi-Threading**: Exercises applying thread synchronization techniques to solve practical concurrency problems.
